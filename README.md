### 2/28

- Each tab of the main panel will feature selections relevant to the chosen destination (i.e. what's going on in the news, what to do, where to eat, how's the weather??)

-  Add more functionality to google maps UI

- TWITTER AND YELP API CONNECTION IS DONE!
- we can search location, pulls tweets for the location, search for food there
- maybe do some analysis: 
- most popular food by rating
- get distance matrix for destination and surrounding food places where rating >4.5) something the user can iput
- addMarker() for food places
- gather all inputs on startup/intro screen, then take in inputs to prepare the tabs
- Google search API: https://serpapi.com/
